      <h2>code blog #1</h2>
	<em>April 9, 2018</em>	

        <p>Prior to doing this assignment, I had no prior experience with html code or any aspect of web development programming languages; I have taken all required computer science 100 level classes as well as data structures but have no other programming experience outside of the languges covered in those courses.</p>
        <p>However, because HTML syntax is relatively simplistic, the example code given in the class notes taught me enough to complete the assignment easfully.</p>
        <p>One aspect that I had trouble with was figuring out that in order to do the assignment I needed to download git onto my machine and figuring out how to push my newly updated files from my local repository to my remote assignment repository on github.</p>
        <p>I have little prior experience with github so this was my biggest obstacle in the assignment.</p>
        <p>I figured out how to navigate git and github by watching and reviewing the provided tutorials.</p>
        <p>Because I had no prior knowledge about how to navigate the programs, languages, and websites used in the assignment, I learned a lot during the process.</p>
        <p>I learned how to code in HTML as well as how to create repositories, branches, files etc. om git/github and edit, commit, push, pull, review etc to each of these parts of a repository.</p>
